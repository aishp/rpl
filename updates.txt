1. Floating node: 
  Actions to perform upon DIS receipt:
    1. if (floating) return
       else
        start trickle timer (if tflag not set)
        unicast back DIO
    2. What is the use of DIS? Should I even unpack it?
2. Actions to perform upon receipt of DIO
  1. if dis is being multicast-> stop mcast
  2. add to parent table
  3. self rank = -1 or self_rank>new_rank+1
      new pref parent
      re-init DIO
      new instance of trickle timer
    else
      trickle counter ++
  
      
3. Trickle timer
  When should trickle timer be reset?


Questions
1. Does a node need to know it's children?
2. Returning from trickle timer when instance has changed: return cord_return(L,0)?
3. Recv DIS: What is the DIS used for?
4. Can we assume that root never dies (root is the node connected to border router)
5. What should DIS contain?
6. What happens when a root receives a DIO? (No action?)
7. Does root change trickle instance only for global repair? Does root participate in local repair?
8. When does a global repair take place?
